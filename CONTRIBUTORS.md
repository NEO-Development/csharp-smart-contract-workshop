The original idea as well as the structure, and content of this workshop was created by Chris Hager (@metachris) for the NEO Python community: [Workshop for programming smart contracts with Python (python-smart-contract-workshop)](https://github.com/CityOfZion/python-smart-contract-workshop) ([https://github.com/CityOfZion/python-smart-contract-workshop](https://github.com/CityOfZion/python-smart-contract-workshop)).

This C# version of the workshop, [Workshop for programming smart contracts with .NET, C# and Visual Studio (csharp-smart-contract-workshop)](https://github.com/mwherman2000/csharp-smart-contract-workshop) ([https://github.com/mwherman2000/csharp-smart-contract-workshop](https://github.com/mwherman2000/csharp-smart-contract-workshop)), is a parallel effort based on Chris's original [workshop content](https://github.com/CityOfZion/python-smart-contract-workshop) (March 2018).
